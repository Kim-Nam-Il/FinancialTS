# Python Implementation for "Financial Time Series" by Ruey S. Tsay

Explore "Financial Time Series" on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Financial-Time-Ruey-Tsay/dp/8126548932/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ISBN+978-0-470-41435-4&qid=1577994389&sr=8-1/).

## 1. Introduction

Inthe contemporary financial world, Python has emerged as a leading tool for financial analysis. During my undergraduate studies, I delved into financial analysis through Ruey S. Tsay's insightful book. However, I noticed a significant gap: there was a lack of Python-based resources and examples complementing Tsay's teachings. Recognizing this, I decided to create this GitHub repository. It's designed to bridge this gap by providing Python code examples and resources, making Tsay's concepts more accessible to everyone studying his book.

Before you are dive into the coding you need to download files in [RUEY S. TSAY's Website](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ruey-s-tsay/research/analysis-of-financial-time-series-3rd-edition)
