## 1. Introduction

In the contemporary financial world, Python has emerged as a leading tool for financial analysis. During my undergraduate studies, I delved into financial analysis through Ruey S. Tsay's insightful book. However, I noticed a significant gap: there was a lack of Python-based resources and examples complementing Tsay's teachings. Recognizing this, I decided to create this GitHub repository. It's designed to bridge this gap by providing Python code examples and resources, making Tsay's concepts more accessible to everyone studying his book.
